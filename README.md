# 🎮 Higher or Lower Game – Python Edition
A fun and simple Higher or Lower Game where players guess whether the next randomly generated number will be higher or lower than the previous one. This game is a great way to practice Python logic, random number generation, and basic game mechanics.

Developed by **Tejas Nivrutti Divase**

# 🎯 Features
Random number generation

Player guesses whether the next number will be higher or lower

Score tracking with real-time feedback

Simple command-line interface (CLI)

Option to play multiple rounds or exit the game

Easy to modify or extend (e.g., difficulty levels, timed rounds)

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3

random module (for generating random numbers)

time module (optional for adding delays)

Conditionals and loops for gameplay logic

# 💡 How the Game Works
The game starts with a random number.

The player guesses whether the next number will be higher or lower.

If the guess is correct, the player continues; if not, the game ends.

The score tracks how many correct guesses the player made in a row.

The player can play multiple rounds or exit at any time.

# 📸 Sample Output
Welcome to the Higher or Lower Game!
Current number: 42
Will the next number be higher or lower?
Enter 'h' for higher or 'l' for lower: h
Next number is 58. You guessed correctly! Your score is 1.

# 📌 Future Improvements
Add a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)

Implement a high score tracker

Add a timer for more challenge

Make the game graphical with Tkinter or Pygame

Add an AI opponent that guesses for you
